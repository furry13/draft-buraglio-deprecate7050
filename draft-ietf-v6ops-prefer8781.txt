                   draft-ietf-v6ops-prefer8781-latest

Abstract

   On networks providing IPv4-IPv6 translation (RFC7915), hosts and
   other endpoints need to know the IPv6 prefix(es) used for translation
   (the NAT64 prefix).  This document provides guidelines for NAT64
   prefix discovery, specifically recommending obtaining the NAT64
   prefix from Router Advertisement option (RFC8781) when available.

1.  Introduction

   Devices translating between IPv4 and IPv6 packet headers [RFC7915]
   use a NAT64 prefix to map IPv4 addresses into the IPv6 address space,
   and vice versa.  When a network provides NAT64, it is advantageous
   for endpoints to acquire the network's NAT64 prefixes (PREF64).
   Discovering the PREF64 enables endpoints to:

   *  Implement the customer-side translator (CLAT) function of the
      464XLAT architecture [RFC6877].

   *  Translate IPv4 literals to IPv6 literals (Section 7.1 of
      [RFC8305]).

   *  Perform local DNS64 [RFC6147] functions.

   *  Support applications relying on IPv4 address referral
      (Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7225]).

   Dynamic PREF64 discovery is useful to keep the NAT64 prefix
   configuration up-to-date, particularly for unmanaged endpoints or
   endpoints which move between networks.  [RFC7050] introduces the
   first DNS64-based mechanism for PREF64 discovery based on [RFC7051]
   analysis.  However, subsequent methods have been developed to address
   [RFC7050] limitations.

   For instance, [RFC8781] defines a Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option
   for Router Advertisements (RAs) to convey PREF64 information to
   hosts.  This approach offers several advantages (Section 3 of
   [RFC8781]), including fate sharing with other host network
   configuration parameters.

   Due to fundamental shortcomings of the [RFC7050] mechanism
   (Section 4), [RFC8781] is the preferred solution for new deployments.
   Implementations should strive for consistent PREF64 acquisition
   methods.  The DNS64-based mechanism of [RFC7050] should be employed
   only when RA-based PREF64 delivery is unavailable, or as a fallback
   for legacy systems incapable of processing the PREF64 RA Option.

2.  Terminology

   DNS64: a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records,
   defined in [RFC6147].

   NAT64: a mechanism for translating IPv6 packets to IPv4 packets and
   vice versa.  The translation is done by translating the packet
   headers according to the IP/ICMP Translation Algorithm defined in
   [RFC7915].  NAT64 translators can operate in stateful ([RFC6144]) or
   stateless mode (e.g. customer-side translator, CLAT, [RFC6877]).
   This document uses "NAT64" as a generalized term for a translator
   which uses the stateless IP/ICMP translation algorithm defined in
   [RFC7915] and operates within a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation
   described in [RFC6144].

   PREF64 (or Pref64::/n, or NAT64 prefix): An IPv6 prefix used for IPv6
   address synthesis and for network addresses and protocols translation
   from IPv6 clients to IPv4 servers using the algorithm defined in
   [RFC6052].

   Router Advertisement (RA): A packet used by Neighbor Discovery
   [RFC4861] and SLAAC to advertise the presence of the routers,
   together with other IPv6 configuration information.

   SLAAC: StateLess Address AutoConfiguration, [RFC4862]

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommendations for PREF64 Discovery

3.1.  Deployment Recommendations for Endpoints

   Endpoints SHOULD attempt to obtain PREF64 information from RAs per
   [RFC8781] instead of using [RFC7050] method.  In the absence of the
   PREF64 information in RAs, an endpoint MAY choose to fall back to the
   mechanism defined in RFC7050.  This recommendation to prefer the
   [RFC8781] mechanism over one defined in [RFC7050] is consistent with
   Section 5.1 of [RFC8781].

3.2.  Deployment Recommendations for Operators

   Operators deploying NAT64 SHOULD provide PREF64 information in Router
   Advertisements per [RFC8781].

3.2.1.  Mobile Network Considerations

   While [RFC8781] support is widely integrated into modern operating
   systems on mobile endpoints, equipment deployed in mobile network
   environments often lacks abilities to include the PREF64 Option into
   RAs.  Therefore, the immediate deployment and enablement of PREF64 by
   mobile operators may not currently be feasible and the
   recommendations outlined in this document are not presently
   applicable to mobile network operators.  These environments are
   encouraged to incorporate [RFC8781] when made practical by
   infrastructure upgrades or software stack feature additions.

3.2.2.  Migration Considerations

   Transitioning from the [RFC7050] heuristic to using the [RFC8781]
   approach might require a period where both mechanisms coexist.  The
   duration of such period and feasibility of discontinuing DNS64
   support, relying solely on RA-based PREF64 signaling in a given
   network depends on the endpoint footprint, particularly the presence
   and number of endpoints running outdated operating systems, which do
   not support [RFC8781].

   Migrating away from DNS64-based discovery also reduces dependency on
   DNS64 in general, thereby eliminating DNSSEC and DNS64
   incompatibility concerns (Section 6.2 of [RFC6147]).

4.  Existing Issues with RFC7050

   DNS-based method of discovering the NAT64 prefix introduces some
   challenges, which make this approach less preferable than latest
   developed alternatives (such as PREF64 RA Option, [RFC8781]).  This
   section outlines the key issues, associated with [RFC7050], with a
   focus on those not discussed in [RFC7050] or in the analysis of
   solutions for hosts to discover NAT64 prefix ([RFC7051]).

4.1.  Dependency on Network-Provided Recursive Resolvers

   Fundamentally, the presence of the NAT64 and the exact value of the
   prefix used for the translation are network-specific attributes.
   Therefore, [RFC7050] requires the endpoint discovering the prefix to
   use the DNS64 resolvers provided by the network.  If the device or an
   application is configured to use other recursive resolvers or runs a
   local recursive resolver, the corresponding name resolution APIs and
   libraries are required to recognize 'ipv4only.arpa.' as a special
   name and give it special treatment.  This issue and remediation
   approach are discussed in [RFC8880].  However, it has been observed
   that very few [RFC7050] implementations support [RFC8880]
   requirements for special treatment of 'ipv4only.arpa.'.  As a result,
   configuring such systems and applications to use resolvers other than
   the one provided by the network breaks the PREF64 discovery, leading
   to degraded user experience.

   VPN applications may override the endpoint's DNS configuration, for
   example, by configuring enterprise DNS servers as the node's
   recursive resolvers and forcing all name resolution through the VPN.
   These enterprise DNS servers typically lack DNS64 functionality and
   therefore cannot provide information about the PREF64 used within the
   local network.  Consequently, this prevents the endpoint from
   discovering the necessary PREF64, negatively impacting its
   connectivity on IPv6-only networks.

   If both the network-provided DNS64 and the endpoint's resolver happen
   to utilize the Well-Known Prefix (64:ff9b::/96, [RFC6052]), the
   endpoint would end up using a PREF64 that's valid for the current
   network.  However, if the endpoint changes its network attachment, it
   can't detect if the new network lacks NAT64 entirely or uses a
   network-specific NAT64 prefix (NSP, [RFC6144]).

4.2.  Network Stack Initialization Delay

   When using SLAAC, an IPv6 host typically requires a single RA to
   acquire its network configuration.  For IPv6-only endpoints, timely
   PREF64 discovery is critical, particularly for those performing local
   DNS64 or NAT64 functions, such as CLAT ([RFC6877]).  Until a PREF64
   is obtained, the endpoint's IPv4-only applications and communication
   to IPv4-only destinations are impaired.  The mechanism defined in
   [RFC7050] does not bundle PREF64 information with other network
   configuration parameters.

4.3.  Latency in Updates Propagation

   Section 3 of [RFC7050] states: "The node SHALL cache the replies it
   receives during the Pref64::/n discovery procedure, and it SHOULD
   repeat the discovery process ten seconds before the TTL of the Well-
   Known Name's synthetic AAAA resource record expires."  As a result,
   once a PREF64 is discovered, it will be used until the TTL expired,
   or until the node disconnects from the network.  There is no
   mechanism for an operator to force the PREF64 rediscovery on the node
   without disconnecting the node from the network.  If the operator
   needs to change the PREF64 value used in the network, they need to
   proactively reduce the TTL value returned by the DNS64 server.  This
   method has two significant drawbacks:

   *  Many networks utilize external DNS64 servers and therefore have no
      control over the TTL value, if the PREF64 needs to be changed or
      withdrawn.

   *  The PREF64 changes need to be planned and executed at least TTL
      seconds in advance.  If the operator needs to notify nodes that a
      particular prefix must not be used (e.g. during a network outage
      or if the nodes learnt a rogue PREF64 as a result of an attack),
      it might not be possible without interrupting the network
      connectivity for the affected nodes.

4.4.  Multihoming Implications

   Section 3 of [RFC7050] requires a node to examine all received AAAA
   resource records to discover one or more PREF64s and to utilize all
   learned prefixes.  However, this approach presents challenges in some
   multihomed topologies where different DNS64 servers belonging to
   different ISPs might return different PREF64s.  In such cases, it is
   crucial that traffic destined for synthesized addresses is sent to
   the correct NAT64 and the source address selected for those flows
   belongs to the prefix from that ISP's address space.  In other words,
   the node needs to associate each discovered PREF64 with upstream
   information, including the IPv6 prefix and default gateway.
   Currently, there is no reliable way for a node to map a DNS64
   response (and the prefix learned from it) to a specific upstream in a
   multihoming scenario.  Consequently, the node might inadvertently
   select an incorrect source address for a given PREF64 and/or send
   traffic to the incorrect uplink.

4.5.  Security Implications

   As discussed in Section 7 of [RFC7050], the DNS-based PREF64
   discovery is prone to DNS spoofing attacks.  In addition to creating
   a wider attack surface for IPv6 deployments, [RFC7050] has other
   security challenges worth noting to justify declaring it legacy.

4.5.1.  Definition of Secure Channel

   [RFC7050] requires a node's communication channel with a DNS64 server
   to be a "secure channel" which it defines to mean "a communication
   channel a node has between itself and a DNS64 server protecting DNS
   protocol-related messages from interception and tampering."  This
   need is redundant when another communication mechanism of
   IPv6-related configuration, specifically RAs, can already be defended
   against tampering, for example by enabling RA-Guard [RFC6105].
   Requiring nodes to implement two defense mechanisms when only one is
   necessary when [RFC8781] is used in place of [RFC7050] creates
   unnecessary risk.

4.5.2.  Secure Channel Example of IPsec

   One of the two examples that [RFC7050] defines to qualify a
   communication channel with a DNS64 server is the use of an "IPsec-
   based virtual private network (VPN) tunnel".  As of the time of this
   writing, this is not supported as a practice by any common operating
   system DNS client.  While they could, there have also since been
   multiple mechanisms defined for performing DNS-specific encryption
   such as those defined in [RFC9499] that would be more appropriately
   scoped to the applicable DNS traffic.  These are also compatible with
   encrypted DNS advertisement by the network using Discovery of
   Network-designated Resolvers [RFC9463] that would ensure the clients
   know in advance that the DNS64 server supported the encryption
   mechanism.

4.5.3.  Secure Channel Example of Link Layer Encryption

   The other example given by [RFC7050] that would allow a communication
   channel with a DNS64 server to qualify as a "secure channel" is the
   use of a "link layer utilizing data encryption technologies".  As of
   the time of this writing, most common link layer implementations use
   data encryption already with no extra effort needed on the part of
   network nodes.  While this appears to be a trivial way to satisfy
   this requirement, it also renders the requirement meaningless since
   any node along the path can still read the higher-layer DNS traffic
   containing the translation prefix.  This seems to be at odds with the
   definition of "secure channel" as explained in Section 2.2 of
   [RFC7050].

5.  Security Considerations

   Obtaining PREF64 information using RAs improves the overall security
   of an IPv6-only endpoint as it mitigates all attack vectors related
   to spoofed or rogue DNS response, as discussed in Section 7 of
   [RFC7050].  Security considerations related to obtaining PREF64
   information from RAs are discussed in Section 7 of [RFC8781].

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not introduce any IANA considerations.
